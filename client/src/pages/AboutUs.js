            Have you ever thought to yourself... "I need somewhere new to
            explore?" Well you reached the right place. Welcome to Eye Spy!

            Eye Spy started off as an idea with a group of friends and
            classmates. We tried to think "What do we want to do? What isn't
            super mainstream right now but could have a lot of promise?" and
            that's where Eye Spy came into action. Eye Spy came into fruition
            after an exploration of our hobbies. We thought... what do we want
            to do, that could be super unique, that all of us have some passion
            in? and then this came up. We created Eye Spy in July 2022, to show
            our growth and experience over the course of our class.
